Practice using Ajax to access a public API

Now that you know about using Ajax to access APIs, let's make your Walker say something when you click on him / her / it!

This will force you to dig into docs from online APIs. If you see a command (i.e. `curl`) that you are not familiar with, look it up and get comfortable with it! 

## Requirements
- Make a new branch of your Walker repo called "ajax"
- By using the javascript `onclick` event, fire an API call to the [theysaidso.com](https://theysaidso.com/api/) database of famous quotes.
- Display the returned data in the console
- Display just the quote at the top of the page (as opposed to the entire JSON data that is returned)
- The quote should change each time The Walker is clicked
- Push your branch to your github account

## Bonus!
 - More API practice is always a good thing. When clicked, make your Walker display a tweet from:
  - the Providence area
    - [Twitter search api docs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/search/tweets)
  - a presidential candidate from this past election
    - [Twitter user timeline docs](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/reference/get/statuses/user_timeline)
